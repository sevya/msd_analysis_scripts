# msd_analysis_scripts
Analysis scripts for running restrained multistate design

These scripts are designed to make running restrained multistate design (R-MSD) within Rosetta much easier. They contain ways to generate input files, manipulate PDB structures, and analyze designed sequences.

Note - almost all scripts in this directory are interdependent. If you move one out of the folder this will break the dependencies and cause problems. Also BioPython and Python version >=2.7 are required.
