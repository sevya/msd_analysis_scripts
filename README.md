# msd_analysis_scripts
Analysis scripts for running multi-specificity design with RECON

These scripts are designed to make running restrained convergence in multi-specificity design (RECON) within Rosetta much easier. They contain ways to generate input files, manipulate PDB structures, and analyze designed sequences. This method is described in Sevy PLOS Comp Bio 2015.

Note - almost all scripts in this directory are interdependent. If you move one out of the folder this will break the dependencies and cause problems. Also BioPython and Python version >=2.7 are required.
